To use the website, the first thing you need to do is register an account. The account will help you store your setting personally and you only need to enter your email and password to login next time. Here you have to follow the rule of setting password, which makes your password safe and hard to hack. You don't have to worry about the security becuase we use JWT to communicate with the back end server. Your personal information is invisible when transmitting.
